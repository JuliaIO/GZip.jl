These functions allow the reading and writing of gzip files.\n\nNotes\n\nThis interface is only for gzipped files, not the streaming zlib   compression interface. Internally, it depends on/uses the   streaming interface, but the gzip related functions are higher   level functions pertaining to gzip files only.\nGZipStream is an implementation of IO and can be used virtually   anywhere IO is used.\nThis implementation mimics the IOStream implementation, and should be a   drop-in replacement for IOStream, with some caveats:\nseekend and truncate are not available\nreaduntil is available, but is not very efficient. (But readline works fine.)\n\nIn addition to open, gzopen, and gzdopen, the following IO/IOStream functions are supported:\n\nclose()\nflush()\nseek()\nskip()\nposition()\neof()\nread()\nreaduntil()\nreadline()\nwrite()\npeek()\n\nDue to limitations in zlib, seekend and truncate are not available.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#GZip.GZError","page":"Home","title":"GZip.GZError","text":"GZError <: Exception\n\ngzip error number and string.
